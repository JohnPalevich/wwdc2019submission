 # Welcome to Firewatcher
 
 - Author: John Palevich
 
 You have taken up the job of being a Fire Watcher at a Famous National Park.
 
 Your job is to make sure the forest is safe.
 
 ## Setup
 
 Tap on the "Run My Code" button
 
 Point your camera at a flat horizontal surface, such as a table or floor.
 
 Move the Camera back and forth until the Forest appears

 ## Gameplay
 
 During your watch, fires will randomly start.

 To put them out, tap on the tree with the fire.
 
 If you let the fire burn for too long, it will spread to nearby trees. If a tree is on fire for more than 10 seconds, it will die.
